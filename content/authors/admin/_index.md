      Thesis: "On the Compaction of Granular Matter; Continuum and Discrete Numerical Modelling"

      Worked on the compaction process of pharmaceutical powders into tablets. My thesis describes the numerical methods developed, particularly with a focus on powder mixture behaviour and particle shape. I also experimentally studied tablet-tooling friction during ejection.

      Supervised by [Prof. J.A. Elliott](https://www.msm.cam.ac.uk/people/elliott), in close collaboration with Novo Nordisk, [Dr. Ioannis Fragkopoulos](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ioannisfragkopoulos?originalSubdomain=dk).

    summary: |
      Developing a fast hierarchical multiscale model of granular matter to improve predictions of e.g. sand. I use the discrete element method (DEM) to derive the constituitive behaviour while the finite element method (FEM) provides the boundary conditions. Advanced statistical methods are then used to reduce the number of required DEM simulations.

      I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural network’s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

    summary: |
      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.
