      Thesis: "On the Compaction of Granular Matter; Continuum and Discrete Numerical Modelling"

      Worked on the compaction process of pharmaceutical powders into tablets. My thesis describes the numerical methods developed, particularly with a focus on powder mixture behaviour and particle shape. I also experimentally studied tablet-tooling friction during ejection.

    summary: |
      Developing a fast hierarchical multiscale model of granular matter to improve predictions of e.g. sand. I use the discrete element method (DEM) to derive the constituitive behaviour while the finite element method (FEM) provides the boundary conditions. Advanced statistical methods are then used to reduce the number of required DEM simulations.

## About Me

I am a researcher in computational mechanics with a focus on granular materials and their impact on environmental and industrial systems. My work combines physics-based modeling, high-performance computing, and experimental validation to develop predictive methods for complex particulate systems. With applications spanning pharmaceuticals, civil engineering, and natural resource management, I aim to bridge fundamental science with practical impact. I am also committed to open-source software development and fostering inclusive scientific collaboration.
