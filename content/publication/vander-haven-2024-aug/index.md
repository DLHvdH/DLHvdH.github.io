abstract: The magnitude of the frictional forces during the ejection of porous pharmaceutical tablets plays an important role in determining the occurrence of tabletting defects. Here, we perform a systematic comparison between the maximum ejection force, static friction coefficient, and kinetic friction coefficient. All of these metrics have different physical meanings, corresponding to different stages of ejection. However, experimental limitations have previously complicated comparisons, as static and kinetic friction could not be measured simultaneously. This study presents a method for simultaneously measuring the maximum ejection force, static friction coefficient, and kinetic friction coefficient in situ during tablet ejection in routine compaction simulator experiments. Using this method, we performed a systematic comparison, including variations of (1) ejection speed, (2) compaction pressure, (3) material, and (4) lubrication method. The relative importance of each variable is discussed in detail, including how ejection speed alone can be a decisive factor in tablet chipping. The reliability of the newly developed method is supported by excellent agreement with previous studies and finite element method (FEM) simulations. Finally, we discuss the suitability of friction coefficients derived from Janssen–Walker theory and explanations for the phenomenon of die-wall static friction coefficients with apparent values far above unity.

summary: This study present a new method to measure both static and kinetic friction between the tablet and die wall during ejection.
